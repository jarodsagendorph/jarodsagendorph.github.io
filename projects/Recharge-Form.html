			<h1>Generic Recharge Form</h1>
			<p>This was a small pilot project I designed for UMass Animal Care Services in 2019. The goal was to create a simple way in which management could keep track of reeipts in a simple space and generate a recharge form to submit to the University. This generic version was created using JavaScript and the Google Suite, including Google Docs, Sheets, and Forms. When a form is filled out, the responses are automatically recorded in a spreadsheet, and a recharge form is generated in Google Docs.</p>
