		<h1>Hi, I'm Jarod</h1>
		<p>Thanks for checking out my website! This website is currently still under construction, but feel free to look around! I hope to be adding more to it regularly (as well as making some much-needed cosmetic changes) as I get new ideas and create some new projects.</p>
		<p>I'm a recent graduate of <a href="http://www.umass.edu/">UMass Amherst</a> where I earned a B.S. in Computer Science through the College of Information and Computer Sciences and a minor in Linguistics through the College of Humanities and Fine Arts. My interests are at the intersection of technology, urban planning, and law, specifically the ways in which these forces can be used to further equality and social justice.</p>
