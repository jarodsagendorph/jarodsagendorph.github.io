		<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
		<h3>Undergraduate Research Volunteer (December 2020-February 2021)</h3>)
		<p><em>College of Information and Computer Sciences</em></p>
		<p>While working under the mentorship of a Ph.D. student in the computer science department, I was able to get a taste of what computational research looks like in practice. With my mentor, I explored the theory behind the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit">Multi-Armed Bandit Problem</a> and was able to implement both a generic model and begin work on implementing a practical model for use in financial markets.</p>
		<p>This experience culminated in a presentation event in which the undergraduates presented our work and models to faculty at the College of Information and Computer Sciences and industry professionals.</p>
		<h3>Student Technician (October 2017-Present)</h3>
		<p><em>UMass Amherst Animal Care Service</em></p>
		<p>While working forr Animal Care Services, I conceptualized and implemented an electronic ordering system to modernize and streamline the ordering process, which has been adopted for regular use throughout the department. I have also done data entry for management in order to better assess time management throughout the animal care team and the associated cost of care for maintaining lab animal colonies. My technical skills also allowed me to provide technical support to employees ranging from hardware installation to software troubleshooting.</p>
